# Exercise 1: calling built-in functions

# Create a variable `my.name` that contains your name
my.name <- 'Muhammad Hussain'

# Create a variable `name.length` that holds how many letters (including spaces)
# are in your name (use the `nchar()` function)

name.length <- nchar(my.name);

# Print the number of letters in your name
print(name.length);

# Create a variable `now.doing` that is your name followed by "is programming!" 
# (use the `paste()` function)
now.doing <- paste(my.name ,  "is programming")
print (now.doing);
# Make the `now.doing` variable upper case
toupper(now.doing)

### Bonus

# Pick two of your favorite numbers (between 1 and 100) and assign them to 
# variables `fav.1` and `fav.2`


# Divide each number by the square root of 201 and save it the new value in the
# original variable


# Create a variable `raw.sum` that is the sum of the two variables. Use the 
# `sum()` function for practice.


# Create a variable `round.sum` that is the `raw.sum` rounded to 1 decimal place.
# Use the `round()` function.


# Create two new variables `round.1` and `round.2` that are your `fav.1` and 
# `fav.2` variables rounded to 1 decimal places


# Create a variable `sum.round` that is the sum of the rounded values


# Which is bigger, `round.sum` or `sum.round`? (You can use the `max()` function!)
